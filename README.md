This is a project to automatically manage your file system. More documentation is TBA:
- Improve implementation design and improve extensibility
- Add more possible data sources (e.g. taking from discord servers)
- Include documentation on how to configure behavior (i.e. via config file and filters)

I am making this solely for personal use, so the focus of this project will be on actual functionality  over ease of use.
